For this, we need a software decoder and an SDR to work. Here is how I have set up my environment:

- OS: Linux
- Distro: [pentoo](https://pentoo.ch/about)
- Laptop: [Framework 13](https://frame.work/laptop13)
- Software Decoder: [SDRTrunk](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk) 
- Software-Defined Radio(SDR): [Nooelec NESDR SMArt v5](https://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-smart.html?srsltid=AfmBOooHum0eNcuoD83_Jwe7QOOuv55OR853rka0QjH8DEV6Oq22_K4Z) // [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/NooElec-NESDR-Smart-Bundle-R820T2-Based/dp/B01GDN1T4S)

# SDRTrunk

SDRTrunk is an open source software decoder for monitoring trunked radio systems using Software-Defined Radios (SDRs).

## Downloading SDRTrunk

The first thing we need to do is download it from the [official repository](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk).
Get the latest release version under `Releases`

![Releases_Page](/p25_images/releases_page.png)

Under `Assets`, we have all the compiled and compressed binaries for that version. Since we are on **Pentoo x86_64** (64-bit) we will download the `sdr-trunk-linux-x86_64-v0.6.1.zip` file

![linux_binary](/p25_images/linux_binary.png)

Now that we have it downloaded, we need to unzip the file

```shell
unzip ~/Downloads/sdr-trunk-linux-x86_64-v0.6.1.zip
```
![Unzip](/p25_images/unzipping.png)

The `sdr-trunk` binary can be found in `sdr-trunk-linux-x86_64-v0.6.1/bin/`

![sdr-trunk](/p25_images/sdr-trunk_binary.png)

We can launch it by moving to the directory and running `./sdr-trunk` or just

```shell
./sdr-trunk-linux-x86_64-v0.6.1/bin/sdr-trunk
```
> Make sure you plug your SDR directly into the usb port of your laptop before launching sdrtrunk
{: .prompt-info}

## Setting up SDRTrunk

After you start sdr-trunk for the first time you will get this screen.

![gpu calibration](/p25_images/gpu_calibration.png)

You should read it, and then select <kbd>Calibrate</kbd>.

![gpu calibrating](/p25_images/gpu_calibrating.png)

While it's calibrating, you shouldn't do anything. Wait until it's finished. 

Then restart sdr-trunk, after the calibration is done.

Now, go to View > User Preferences > `JMBE Audio Library` and click on <kbd>Create Library</kbd>, you will get the screen below. 

![Jmbe Library](/p25_images/jmb3_library_update.png)

Choose <kbd>Yes</kbd> and choose <kbd>Create Library</kbd> on the screen after.

Next go to `Output/Tones` and test your audio to make sure you can hear the `beep`. If you can't hear anything after hitting <kbd>Test</kbd>, make sure:
  - Your speakers aren't muted
  - You have tested all the speakers listed under `Audio Output Device` and none of them work
  - You can hear audio when you go on YouTube

> If you have tested and confirmed all the above, and you still can't hear anything in SDRTrunk, read the next section below `Audio Issue Fixed` for a possible solution. Otherwise, just skip it and continue to `Setting up a Playlist`
{: .prompt-tip}

### Audio Issue Fixed 

List your audio devices
```shell
aplay -l
```
![audio devices](/p25_images/listing_audio_devices.png)

In my case, my audio device is `card 1`. I will now launch sdr-trunk this way:
```shell
ALSA_CARD=1 ./sdr-trunk
```
Test the audio now, it should work! :)

> You will have to launch sdr-trunk this way every time for the audio to work. However, I'm working on finding a better fix that will let you launch sdr-trunk normally. I will update this page, once I test it and it works fine.

For a good understanding of how this all works, check out [Advanced Linux Sound Architecture](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Select_the_default_PCM_via_environment_variable). It's very informative, and you might be able to find the ultimate fix.

## Finding a frequency

Now, we need to find a frequency we want to monitor. Let's visit [RadioReference](https://www.radioreference.com)

Once there:
- Click on Databases > RR Database > <kbd>Browse</kbd>

You will see this map

![map](/p25_images/state_map.png)

Find your state on the map and select it. For example, let's select `Virginia` on the Map. It will take us here

![virginia](/p25_images/Virginia.png)

At the bottom there is the `System Name`, we can select it. That will lead us to the next page below

![STARS](/p25_images/STARS.png)

As we can see next to `System Type`, Virginia uses Project 25 (P25). 

Now, select your county under `County`. Let's select `Loundoun`.
On the next page, we should see something like this

![frequency](/p25_images/frequency.png)

We are looking for P25 under `Mode`. So far we are seeing, FMN and FM. Let's keep scrolling on the page and hope we see P25.

P25 is the digital trunked radio standard used by most public safety agencies, so monitoring it lets you follow real police/fire/EMS activities. 

> P25e is P25 but encrypted. We should not use those frequencies.
{: .prompt-danger}

At the bottom of the page, we found a P25 frequency: `773.40625`
![p25](/p25_images/p25.png)

Now that we have our target frequency, let's configure SDRTrunk to monitor it by creating a playlist.

## Setting Up a Playlist

From the main screen, click on <kbd>Playlist Editor</kbd>

![Playlist](/p25_images/playlist_editor.png)

Then, click on <kbd>Channels</kbd> on the next screen. Next, click on <kbd>...</kbd> on the right side of the screen

![Channel](/p25_images/channels.png)

Choose `P25 Phase 1`, and you should see something like this below:

![configuring](/p25_images/configuring.png)

You can put whatever you want or whatever helps you organize your playlist for the following:
- `System`, `Site` and `Name`

They are just Optional Labels. What you do want to pay attention to is the `Frequencies (MHz)`


Let's put in our target frequency `773.40625`. This is what our playlist looks like

![Playlist Finished](/p25_images/Finished.png)

Make sure you hit `save` on the right and then hit <kbd>Play</kbd>.

![failed](/p25_images/failed.png)

On the spectrum, it doesn't look like there is any traffic on `773.40625`.

> P25 systems are often quiet depending on time/day. No one's talking at this time on 773.40625, for example.
> We can try:
> - Another P25 control channel freq in your area (Search on RadioReference)
> - Same frequency later (evening rush sometimes = more activity)
{: .prompt-warning}


This is what a busy frequency (when people are talking) looks like

![success](/p25_images/success.png)

The big red line on the spectrum shows **active voice transmissions**. However, if a call is *`Encrypted`* you'll see the spikes (Red Lines) but won't hear anything, that's normal and expected.

> If you have tried everything, and still don't get it to work. I highly recommend joining the [RFHS Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/JjPQhKy) and post your question in `#sdr-chat`
{: .prompt-tip}

The P25 scanner is ready. Now test different frequencies/times to catch live traffic.
